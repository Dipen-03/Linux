# Linux
First, I created a Microsoft Azure account using my university email. 
After setting up the account, I received $100 in credit, which I used to purchase resources for my learning environment. 
Then, I created a virtual machine (VM) for my course projects. 
I named the VM "lab-robotics" and selected the option for no infrastructure redundancy and Trusted launch for security. 
I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 as the operating system and the Standard_B21s_v2 machine 
from the B Series Version 2. After setting up the machine, I got an SSH key and selected the connect option to use native SSH. 
I copied the SSH command and ran it in Windows PowerShell, which allowed me to access the Linux virtual machine on my Windows 
laptop without needing to install Linux. Finally, I created a new "Linux" repository on GitHub for the assignment and linked my 
HAMK email as a secondary email for version control.
