# Assignment 7 - Virtualization  
Submitted by: Dipen Gaihre

## **Part 1: Introduction to Virtualization**  

### **Research on Key Concepts**  

#### **1. Virtualization**  
Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based (or virtual) version of a computer system, including hardware platforms, storage devices, and network resources. It enables multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.  

#### **2. Hypervisor**  
A hypervisor, also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs). It allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical host by distributing resources efficiently.  
- **Type 1 (Bare-metal Hypervisor):** Runs directly on the host hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM).  
- **Type 2 (Hosted Hypervisor):** Runs on a host operating system (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).  

#### **3. Virtual Machines (VMs)**  
A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. It runs its own operating system and applications just like a physical computer. Each VM has its own virtual CPU, RAM, storage, and network interface but operates independently from the host system.  

#### **4. Containers**  
Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, libraries). Unlike VMs, containers share the host OS kernel, making them faster and more resource-efficient. Examples include Docker and LXC.  

#### **5. Differences Between VMs and Containers**  

| Feature | Virtual Machines (VMs) | Containers |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| **Architecture** | Full OS per VM | Shares host OS kernel |
| **Performance** | Slower due to overhead | Faster due to lightweight design |
| **Isolation** | Stronger security, full isolation | Less isolated, shares kernel |
| **Boot Time** | Minutes | Seconds |
| **Resource Usage** | Requires more memory & CPU | Uses less memory & CPU |
| **Use Case** | Best for running multiple OS | Best for microservices and scalable apps |

---

## **Summary**  
- **Virtual Machines** provide complete isolation and run separate operating systems but consume more resources.  
- **Containers** are lightweight, share the host OS kernel, and are ideal for running scalable applications with minimal overhead.  



## **Part 2: Working with Multipass**
 I used the following commands for part 2:
 ### **Step 1: Install Multipass**
        
            sudo snap install multipass

### **Step 2: Test Multipass Commands**

1. Launch a default Ubuntu instance

        multipass launch --name dipen-vm

2. Show running instances

            multipass list

3. Show instance details

        multipass info dipen-vm

4. Access instance shell

         multipass shell dipen-vm

screenshot:

![alt text](multipass2.jpg)


5. Run command inside instance

         multipass exec dipen-vm -- ls

6. Stop instance

        multipass stop dipen-vm

7. Delete instance

         multipass delete dipen-vm

8. Clean up deleted instances

            multipass purge

### **Step 3: Cloud-Init Configuration**

1. Create a file named cloud-init.yaml:

        nano cloud-init.yaml

screenshot:

![alt text](<cloud-init 1.jpg>)

2. Launch an instance with cloud-init

        multipass launch --name dipen-vm --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml


    
3. Create a new folder and Mount the folder inside a VM:

        mkdir -p ~/multipass-share
        multipass mount ~/multipass-share dipen-vm:/mnt/shared



4. Verify the shared folder inside the Multipass instance

        multipass shell dipen-vm
        ls /mnt/shared


5.  create a test file in the shared folder

        echo "Hello from Multipass" > /mnt/shared/testfile.txt

6. Check if the file appears on the host


        ls ~/multipass-share

7. Unmount the shared folder after done

        multipass umount dipen-vm:/mnt/shared

## **Part 3: Exploring LXD**

### **Step 1: Install LXD**
        sudo snap install lxd


### **Step 2: Initialize LXD**
        lxd init



### **Step 3: Create and Manage Containers**

1. Launch a new LXD container

            lxc launch ubuntu:24.04 my-container

2. List running containers

            lxc list

screenshot:

![alt text](<lxd install1.jpg>)



3. Enter the container shell

            lxc exec my-container -- bash

4. Run a command inside the container

            cat /etc/os-release


5. Exit the container
         
           exit

6.  Stop the container


            lxc stop my-container


7. Delete the container

            lxc delete my-container

## **Part 4: Stick Apps with Docker**

I understand the basic concept of docker by visiting the site:

![alt text](<docker understanding.jpg>)

### **Installation of docker in Linux**

        curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

checking version for verification:

![alt text](<docker version.jpg>)

### **Experiment with Docker**

1. Check if Docker is working by running a test container:              

                sudo docker run hello-world

![alt text](<decker helloworls.jpg>)

2. List running containers:

                sudo docker ps -a

3. Pull an official image:

                 docker pull nginx



4. Run the nginx container

             docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx


![alt text](<docker pull nginx.jpg>)

5. Check running containers

                docker ps   


6. Check external IP (using curl)

              curl ifconfig.me

7.  Stop and remove the container
                docker stop my-nginx
                docker rm my-nginx


screenshoot:

### **Problem Encountered:**
Hereâ€™s the issue I encountered while working with Docker:

Problem:
When I tried to stop the container after running Nginx (step 5), I received an error:

                docker stop nginx
                Error response from daemon: No such container: nginx

This happened because I had created a new container with the name zealous_meitner (not nginx), so the stop command using the incorrect name (nginx) led to the error.

Solution:
To resolve this, I had to use the correct container name (zealous_meitner):
                
                docker stop zealous_meitner
                docker rm zealous_meitner

## **Part 5: Snaps for Self-Contained Applications**

### **Key Points on Snapcraft and Snaps**
1. What is Snapcraft?

Snapcraft is a tool for building, packaging, and publishing software as Snaps.
It allows applications to run on different Linux distributions without modification.

2. What are Snaps?

Snaps are self-contained application packages that include all dependencies.
They ensure software runs consistently across various Linux distributions.

3. Features of Snaps:

-Dependency Management: Snaps bundle all required libraries.\
-Automatic Updates: Snaps update automatically in the background.
-Security & Sandboxing: Snaps run in isolation, improving security.\
-Cross-Distribution Support: Work on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, and more.


### **Experiment**

#### **Step 1: Install Snapcraft**

I try to install snapcraft by running the command:
                   
                sudo apt update && sudo apt install snapcraft -y


I found some erro like this:

                No apt package "snapcraft", but there is a snap with that name.
                Try "snap install snapcraft"





and after that, I run the command:

                sudo snap install snapcraft --classic


then, snapcraft is successfully installed:

![alt text](<snap installation-1.jpg>)


#### **Step 2: Create a Snap Project**

                mkdir my-snap-app && cd my-snap-app
                snapcraft init

Output:

                Go to https://docs.snapcraft.io/the-snapcraft-format/8337 for more information about the snapcraft.yaml format.
                Successfully initialised project.


#### **Step 3: Create the Application Script**

                mkdir bin
                nano bin/hello.sh

I Added the following content inside hello.sh:

                #!/bin/bash
                echo "Hello from my snap!"

![alt text](<nano snapcraft.yaml2.jpg>)

Save and exit. Then, make it executable:
        
                chmod +x bin/hello.sh


![alt text](<snapcraft step2.jpg>)


#### **Step 4: Modify snapcraft.yaml**
Open the configuration file:

                nano snap/snapcraft.yaml

Modify it to:

![alt text](<snapcraft yaml correct.jpg>)


#### **Step 5: Build the Snap**

                snapcraft

Output:

                Packed my-snap-app_0.1_amd64.snap

#### **Step 6: Install and Run the Snap**

Install it using:

                sudo snap install my-snap-app_*.snap --devmode


Output:

                Hello from my snap!
